# Chimera's Modpack for modern versions of Hypixel Skyblock

## General concept

- 1.21+
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) ([Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) switch WIP - Doesn't work at the moment, 1.21 is the highest available version for API)
- Reasonable default settings pre-configured to be able to play straight away w/o necessarily spending an hour+ to set the mods up
- allows the Skyblock to be played with UI which doesn't look like it has multiple MMO UI's combined (like in [the meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/sawtmy/hey_i_can_almost_see_the_game_this_time/))
