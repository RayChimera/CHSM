# Chimera's Modpack for modern versions of Hypixel Skyblock

Please read the **Notes** section before installing!

## General concept

- 1.21+
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) ([Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) switch WIP - Doesn't work at the moment, 1.21 is the highest available version for API)
- Reasonable default settings pre-configured to be able to play straight away w/o necessarily spending an hour+ to set the mods up
- allows the Skyblock to be played with UI which doesn't look like it has multiple MMO UI's combined (like in [the meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/sawtmy/hey_i_can_almost_see_the_game_this_time/))

## Notes

- Recommended launcher: [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
- As of now (28/06/2025) [Furfsky Reborn](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/furfsky-reborn) requires adding `-Xss4m` as a Java argument. *Resource packs will likely fail to load* if you won't add that!

## Server
